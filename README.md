# B3DDecomp

Blitz3D and BlitzPlus game disassembler and decompiler

This isn't 100% functional yet so the UX sucks, but here are some usage instructions if you're curious:
- Change the path written in `Blitz3DDisasm/Program.cs` to the executable you want to decompile.
- Run Blitz3DDisasm.
- If you know that the executable you're using is based on [TSS' fork of Blitz3D](https://github.com/Saalvage/Blitz3D), open the folder generated by Blitz3DDisasm and edit `Compiler.txt` to say `Blitz3dTss` instead of `Blitz3d`.
- Change the path written in `Blitz3DDecomp/Program.cs` to the folder generated by Blitz3DDisasm.
- Run Blitz3DDecomp.
